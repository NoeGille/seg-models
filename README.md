# seg-models
## Training and evaluation of two deep segmentation modelsl in PyTorch

This project includes :
  - Implementation of U-Net and UNETR in PyTorch
  - A script to train models
  - A script to evaluate models
  - A script to performs cross-validation
  - A script to prepare Camus for segmentation based on the work of Th√©o Sourget (https://github.com/TheoSourget/SegFormer_CAMUS)
  - A script to prepare a synthetic dataset from the work of Mateus Riva, Pietro Gori, Florian Yger, and Isabelle Bloch. Is the u-net
directional-relationship aware ?, 2022.

This project is made to study and experiment with U-Net and UNETR.

All models and datasets can be saved in .pt format files. Check the code implementation of training.py, crossvalidation.py and dataset_florian.py for further information.
